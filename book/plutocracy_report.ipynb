In fact, ~99.982% of voting power allocated to this proposal came from whales that voted for each of the outcomes. The second outcome alone had ~99.980% of the voting power allocated to this proposal, so obviously, its removal would make a huge impression on the outcome.\n",

However the fact that after doing so additional oracles would still be implemented anyway, where the only other alternative would be to not implement any more oracles, shows that the community that participated in this proposal still saw it important to add more oracles to further promote decentralisation of oracles which [report chain state from the beacon chain to the execution layer](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/oracle-operator-manual) of ETH 2.0 as it pertains to the operation of Lido.\n",

    "There aren't very many Snapshot proposals created on Radicle's DAO, but one proposal whose outcome would've been changed if not for whales was this proposal to [distribute some RAD leftover](https://snapshot.org/#/gov.radicle.eth/proposal/QmepPgXwo5q9GipZFKa32rnxaYoo3LrfRqduinftbU3L3S) from a Liquidity Bootsrapping (LBP) round conducted in February '21. This leftover RAD was proposed to be redistributed to participants of the LBP, i.e. people who bought RAD in this period from the Balancer LBP for RAD tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal had a particularly interesting discussion as it seemed like a classic David v. Goliath square-up. This comment [posted by RAD delegate Abbey](https://radicle.community/t/structured-discussion-distribute-lbp-unsold-tokens-to-the-people-who-contributed-to-the-lbp-in-proportion-to-their-contribution/1944/60) sums up the discussion pretty well (including her thoughts on the matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I don't want to make it seem like I'm siding with Abbey on this one by posting her thoughts on the matter as well, but I hope that her post can summarise the sentiments of the proposal well enough. It was a very sensitive, important and highly controversial proposal that ultimately did not pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not obvious that whales were simply looking out for their own interests on this one. It's worth debating the [intentions of those who took part in these discussions](https://radicle.community/t/structured-discussion-distribute-lbp-unsold-tokens-to-the-people-who-contributed-to-the-lbp-in-proportion-to-their-contribution/1944/61) for this proposal for its passing."
